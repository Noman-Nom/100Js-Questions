//     var:

    // Scope: Function-scoped. If declared inside a function, the variable is only accessible within that function.
     // Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means you can use them before the declaration.
    // Reassignment: Can be reassigned and updated.

    // example


    // for var 
    console.log("...............var .............")

//       let:

    // Reassignment: Can be reassigned but not re-declared in the same scope.
    // example

//     const:

    // Scope: Block-scoped, just like let.
    // Hoisting: Variables declared with const are also hoisted to the top of their block, but like let, they are not initialized.
    // Reassignment: Cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can be modified.

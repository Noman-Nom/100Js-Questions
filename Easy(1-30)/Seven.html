<!-- Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where you assign a single event listener to a common ancestor of multiple elements instead of assigning individual event listeners to each specific element. This way, you can take advantage of event bubbling to handle events for multiple elements efficiently.

The main benefits of event delegation include reduced memory consumption, improved performance, and simplified event management, especially when dealing with dynamic content.

Here's an example to illustrate event delegation: -->

<style>

</style>

</head>
<body>


    <ul id="list-items">
        <li>Task 1</li>
        <li>Task 2</li>
        <li>Task 3</li>
        <li>Task 4</li> 
    </ul>

    

    <script>

        const list  =document.getElementById('list-items')
        console.log(list)
        list.addEventListener('click', (event)=>{
            if(event.target.tagName=='LI'){
                console.log("Task Clicked", event.target.innerText)
            }

        })

    </script>
</body>
